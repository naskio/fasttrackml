# FastTrack Quickstart

## Install Dependencies

FastTrack requires the following dependencies to be installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Run FastTrack

FastTrack can be run using the following command:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 -ti gresearch/fasttrack
```

Verify that you can see the UI by navigating to http://localhost:5000/.

## Run a quick test script

```bash
# Install mflow and poetry
cd docs/dev
poetry install
# MLFlow will not be installed by poetry, so we need to install it manually
poetry run pip install mlflow boto3

python3 minimal.py
```

After running this script, you should see the following output from http://localhost:5000/aim/:

From here you can check out the metrics and run information to see more details about the run.

## Testing a Random Forest Model

**Note that since artifacts are not yet supported, most of the autolog features will not work.**
